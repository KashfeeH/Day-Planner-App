# Module 7 : Day-Planner-App

## Description

This week's challenge was to create a simple calendar application that allows a user to save events for each hour of the day by modifying starter code. As with all other this app too will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery. With jQuery it is supposed to be easier to write Javascript with Jquery however, I found vanilla Javascript easier to use. 

## Functionality

When the user opens the app, first the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar. Next when scrolled down, the user is presented with time blocks for standard business hours  8AM to 5PM. Each time block is color-coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future. The user can enter an event, hit save button and the text will be retained in local storage. Even when the page is refreshed, the event entered persists.
